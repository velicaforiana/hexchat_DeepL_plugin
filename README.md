# AdiIRC Deepl Plugin

This plugin allows to mark nicknames for automatic translation to english using the DeepL API.
A DeepL API Key is required and can be set using the /dl-api command.
/dl-help will list all supported commands.
The most important one would be /dl-mon <nick> to mark that nickname for translation.

In addition to the general translation feature there are some [Fuel Rats](https://fuelrats.com) integrations as well.
Incoming cases and their language can be automatically identified and marked for tranlation if needed.

# Warnings

- Fuel Rats: This plugin is meant for experienced rats.
- Fuel Rat Dispatchers: Always ask the client if they speak English. It is always better to dispatch cases in English if the client speaks it fluently.
